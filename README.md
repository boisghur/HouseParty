## HouseParty
is a web app written in React and Django, integrating the spotify api to allow rooms to control a host's spotify playback by pausing, playing or voting to skip the current song.

**Hosts** can create a room, and set a control level for the guests of that room - grant guests the ability to play/pause, and choose the number of votes required for a song to be skipped. Hosts may also control playback from the app without needing to vote.
